# Income-Tax-Calculator

This project is a Provincial Income Tax Calculator that I built in Excel using formulas, VBA, and macros. The tool automatically calculates CPP, EI, federal tax, provincial tax, total deductions, 
and net income for different Canadian provinces. I used VBA to build the entire tax engine, including the logic for tax brackets and income thresholds, and automated the process of generating monthly,
bi-weekly, and weekly income outputs. The calculator fills the worksheet automatically, formats the results, and handles errors if the user misses any required fields.
I also designed a simple user-friendly interface where users can enter their name, SIN, annual income, and select a province to instantly view their tax breakdown. 
The form includes buttons for running the calculation, generating a report, resetting inputs, and closing the interface. Even though I’ve worked on more complex data projects, 
this one stands out because it’s practical, accurate, and something I still use personally. It’s a great example of combining UI design, automation, and financial logic into a working Excel application.
